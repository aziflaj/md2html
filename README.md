# md2html

Developed through the 25th week of my **Project52**, this is a simple Ruby script that converts a Markdown file into an HTML file. It is not intended to be used as a production-ready gem; [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) is a better version of this (or in fact, this repo is a bad version of Redcarpet).
