This is a paragraph. This is a **bo5ld** word, __also this is bold__. While *this* and _this other_ are italic. I guess ~this is a strikethrough~, but I'm not sure. I guess I can write inline `code` and probably even blocks, like this one:

```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();  // create an Express.js application
```

I guess this is enough... Or is it?

The below is a list:

- of one
- two
- and three
- items

While this other one is an ordered list of:

1. two
2. three
3. or more
4. items
5. ordered

You can insert [links to Google](https://google.com) and IDK what else
