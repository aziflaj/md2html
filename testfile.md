This is a paragraph. This is a **bo5ld** word, __also this is bold__. While *this* and _this other_ are italic. I guess ~this is a strikethrough~, but I'm not sure. I guess I can write inline `code` and probably even blocks, like this one: `5`
**5**
```js
var express = require('express');
var app = express();  // create an Express.js application
```

I guess this is enough... Or is it?
